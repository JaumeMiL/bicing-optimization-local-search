# Local Search Algorithms for Bicing Redistribution 🚲
## A Collaborative Project by Joan Bernaus, Joan Bennàssar, and Jaume Mora

### Overview 📖
This project involves the implementation of local search algorithms, specifically Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing, to optimize bike redistribution in a virtual city's Bicing stations. Developed as part of the Basic Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence course, this work showcases a practical application of these algorithms using the Python AIMA library.

### Features 🛠️
- **Problem Representation**: Simulation of a 10x10 km city with Bicing stations.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Application of Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing to solve the redistribution problem.
- **Initial State Generation**: Strategies for generating starting conditions for the algorithms.
- **Optimization Goals**: Minimize costs while approximating bike demand at each station.
